# Maze-Solver
Java implementation of maze solving algorithms to compare BFS with a queue to DFS with a stack

## Overview
This project implements maze solving algorithms using inheritance and polymorphism. The abstract MazeSolver base class provides common maze-solving functionality, while the subclasses implement different search strategies:

MazeSolverQueue: Implements Breadth-First Search (BFS) - guarantees shortest path
MazeSolverStack: Implements Depth-First Search (DFS) - uses less memory but may not find shortest path

## Maze File Format

Text File with maze dimensions, followed by grid of numbers 0 - 3.

First Line: rows columns

Following Lines:

- 0 = Open Path
- 1 = Wall
- 2 = Start Position
- 3 = Exit Position

## Class Hierarchy

```bash
MazeSolver (abstract)
├── MazeSolverQueue (BFS implementation)
└── MazeSolverStack (DFS implementation)

Supporting Classes:
├── Maze (maze representation and file I/O)
├── MazeSquare (individual maze cells)
├── Queue<E> (custom queue implementation)
├── Stack<E> (custom stack implementation)
└── ListNode<E> (linked list node)
```
